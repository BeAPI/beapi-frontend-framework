## üî¥ Requirements

### Composer
You need composer to autoload all your classes from the inc folder.

Use the `beapi/composer-scaffold-theme` package that add it automatically to the composer.json file.
You can add it yourself like this :

```composer.json
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "BEA\\Theme\\Framework\\": "content/themes/framework/inc/"
        }
    }
```

### Autoload
The autoload is based on psr-4 and handled by composer.

### Node 12+

You need a minimum of Node 12. Version 14 is recommended.

## Installation

Download the latest release of BFF [here](https://github.com/BeAPI/beapi-frontend-framework/releases) and extract the zip archive into your `themes` WordPress's folder.

```bash
|____wp-admin
|____wp-content
| |____plugins
| |____themes
| | |____beapi-frontend-framework
| |____uploads
|____wp-includes
```

Of course, you can rename `beapi-frontend-framework` to define your WordPress theme's name.

Next, go to your theme folder (in the following example, I didn't rename `beapi-frontend-framework`) with your favorite Term software.

```bash
$ cd wp-content/themes/beapi-frontend-framework
```

Then install node dependencies with Yarn.
```bash
$ yarn
```
Alternatively, you can use NPM.
```bash
$ npm install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The configurations files are in `config` directory.
### Webpack
You can find the common Webpack settings file in `webpack.common.js`. For development mode purpose, you can edit `webpack.dev.js` file and for production mode, you can edit `webpack.prod.js`.
You also have the loaders in `loaders.js` file and Webpack's plugin in `plugins.js` file.

### Babel
You can find a `.babelrc` file to modify Babel configuration.

### Eslint
You can find a `.eslintrc` file to modify Eslint configuration.

## üöÄ How to use BFF ?
After installing dependencies, you can run some commands which are explained below.

### Start with Browser Sync

BFF is configured to work with [lando](https://lando.dev/). If you have a `.lando.yml` file in your project's root, set the path to your file in the `browsersync.config.js` file.

```js
let fileContents = fs.readFileSync('../../../../.lando.yml', 'utf8')
```
Then, run the following command from the theme :


```bash
$ yarn start
```
BrowserSync will proxy your lando'server based on the name defined in your `.lando.yml`.
### Build

```bash
$ yarn build
```

### Bundle report

You can launch a bundle report with the following command :

```bash
$ yarn bundle-report
```
