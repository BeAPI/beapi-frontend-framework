# Composerjs ðŸ¦„ #
Composerjs is a little script that let you download SCSS and/or JS snippets from :

https://github.com/BeAPI/bff-components

---

### How it works ? ###
In your theme folder, run the following command and let the magic happens

`$ npm run composerjs`

The script will ask you few questions :
+ What kind of snippet do you need ?
+ Which file you need to download ?
+ Where should I put the downloaded file ?

Congratulations ! ðŸŽ‰

You can now import your snippets into your styles/scripts.
